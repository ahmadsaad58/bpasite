                            <p>Marijuana, more commonly known as weed or cannabis, is a plant that contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and several other psychoactive and anxiolytic elements that contribute towards it being the most illicitly used drug in the world. Coming from the cannabis sativa plant (dry hemp plant), weed has grown to be very popular for its ephemerally relaxing and physical effects. Many people continue to use its medicinal purposes as a scapegoat to continuously go on a high or to use the drug addictively. While many people become more and more accustomed towards using weed, they become blinded towards the adverse effects that come with the drug. Long term brain damage, impairment of motor skills, mood swings, increased heart rate, and pregnancy problems comprise only a small list of the potentially toxic effects your body could have while using the drug recreationally. While these effects may be of minimal importance/possibility in the long run to most people, it is definitive to all people that the use of marijuana has been proven to stress the heart which can lead to a heart attack at any moment. Another major problem that arises is the possibility of synthetic marijuana, which is essentially a deadly concoction of many chemicals of any amount. This has been recognized as a more deadly version of marijuana as it has definitively harmed numerous people who are under the false pretense that is marijuana, when in reality they are drinking none other than their death sentence. Weed,  a speciously innocuous drug that continues to be widely overused,causing harm to many around the world, it is important to curb its usage. </p>

                            <p>Cocaine, a white powder that produces sensations of euphoria, alertness, and energy, is a very powerful stimulant that is commonly injected, snorted, or even smoked. Dating all the way from  the Incas (3000 BCE) , who  were the first to extract the cocoa leaves and chew on them in order to increase their breathing rates, cocaine has become a hugely popular yet powerful drug with several deleterious effects. Initially at first, around the 1800s when the infamous drug first started to gain global traction and eventually to the turn of the century, the drug was seen as a panacea towards psychological problems and common illnesses. Although as higher and higher doses were promoted ubiquitously along with the general increase in availability of the drug itself, more and more people began to experience severe addictions to this drug, regardless of the adverse effects and toll it took on their health. At this point in time, after much experimentation of the drug and wide-spread usage of it, numerous cases of addiction,  death, injuries, and overall pain had been reported. Many people began to see its noxious effects and began to eschew its popularity and growth. In 1922, the U.S. banned the drug’s usage through the population’s general discomfort and harmful effects with the drug. Albeit this, the drug’s rate increased at an alarming rate throughout the next 75 years. In 2008, the drug was so popular around the world that it became the 2nd most trafficked drug. To this day, over 22 million people,  across 174 countries around the world, use the drug in order to gain a sensation of euphoria, alertness, or energy. But many of them are unaware about  the underlying, noxious, and damaging effects the drug brings with it. </p>

                            <p>As the leading factor of driving accidents globally, a cause for almost 88000 deaths annually in the United States , and causing almost 5.9% of all global deaths in 2012, alcohol drug use  is one of the biggest problems that we face today. Alcohol itself is essentially a central nervous system depressant more or less and has numerous effects on your body which prove to be detrimental.  Ranging from reduction in motor skills up to death, there are a wide spread of potentially deadly events that could happen through the use of this drug. One of the major problems associated with this is  binge drinking (over-drinking essentially). Binge drinking not only puts an increased amount of alcohol in one’s system, but also puts an increased amount of pressure onto your liver, which will not be a good thing as it is the largest organ in the body and can lead to severe issues. As people binge drink, the problem that also arises is that the drinks they binge, such as vodka or hard liquor, can contain up to 40 percent of alcohol, which is more than enough to cause death. There are also numerous social problems which come forth with alcohol drug use, such as problems at the workplace, at school, or even with friends. By proving to be a significant factor in the deaths of many Americans, it is important to realize that this drug, can very well prove to be a catastrophe for the upcoming years ahead. That is why, it is important now to instigate an action, in order to help curb its drastic usage. </p>
